An app to make it easier for people to explore interesting and historic places in Medan (beta), with Push Notification.

You have to make your `own firebase project` and add the `auth method + database`. 
Your database name is up to you, but don't forget to change it in the app. 
Also don't forget to add the **Google MAPS API Key** for displaying the maps. You can get it from Google API Console.

```
The push notification will tell you when you are around the place(500m). It will tell you if you are entered the place, moving within the place, or leaved the place
```
